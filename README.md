# Marxist-Leninist Discord Verification Bot

This is a Discord bot that automates political vetting for new users joining a Marxist-Leninist-oriented server. Users are required to complete a quiz via direct message, answering 8 multiple-choice questions. The bot scores their responses, and if they pass the threshold (30/40), they are automatically assigned the **comrade** role on the server.

This bot is designed to deter liberal, reactionary, or fascist infiltration by filtering participants through questions rooted in Marxist-Leninist theory.

## üîß Features

- Sends users an automated DM when they run `!verifyme`
- Asks 8 political-theoretical questions (max 5 points per question)
- Accepts responses in A/B/C/D format (case-insensitive)
- Tallies score and grants access if score ‚â• 30
- Automatically assigns the `comrade` role to verified users
- Provides feedback on score and whether they passed or failed
- Built in Python using `discord.py`

## üí° How It Works

1. A new user joins the server and types `!verifyme` in the `#verification` channel.
2. The bot DMs them a series of 8 questions, one at a time.
3. Each answer is scored (some answers award fewer points; reactionary ones may score zero or negative).
4. If the user scores at least 30/40, they receive the `comrade` role automatically.
5. If not, they are encouraged to study and try again.

This ensures that users entering the space either already align with Marxist-Leninist principles or are sincerely open to learning them.
